# Front-end Template

This directory contains the front-end structure for your project.

## Directory Structure

- `designs/`: Design files and assets (Figma, Sketch, etc.)
- `src/`: Source code for your front-end application
- `public/`: Static assets and public files

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

3. Build for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

## Development Guidelines

- Use functional components
- Follow the component structure in `src/components`
- Keep styles modular and reusable
- Write tests for all components
- Document your components using JSDoc
